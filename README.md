Portable version of Sublime with my personal settings.

Setup:
- `git clone git@github.com:schmich/sublime.git`
- Copy shortcuts in `sublime\User\Projects` as necessary.

Changes made to base Sublime:
- Added the `\User` folder.
- Updated the empty preference files in `\Data\Packages\User`.

- Added file `\Data\Packages\Color Scheme - Default\Merbivore Soft.tmTheme`.
- Updated file `\Data\Packages\Vintage\Vintage.sublime-commands`.
- Updated file `\Data\Packages\Vintage\vintage_commands.py`.
- Added this `README.md` file.
